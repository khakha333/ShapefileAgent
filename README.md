# Shapefile-Agent: LLM-Driven Automated GIS Shapefile Processing

## üöÄ Research Overview
Shapefile-Agent is a multi-agent system leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically **analyze**, **modify**, and **generate** GIS Shapefile vector data via natural language commands.  
A **Supervisor** agent decomposes user requests into subtasks, and specialized **Worker** agents execute Python code (via a REPL) or perform web searches to fulfill each step.

- **Publication Year**: 2024  
- **Topic**: Real-time vector data manipulation with LLM-based multi-agent workflows  
- **Key Results**:  
  - Simple task success rate: **96%** (‚âà20 pp improvement over baseline GPT-4o)  
  - Complex task success rate: **88%**  
  - Real-time code execution & visualization for transparency and user collaboration  


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

1. **Install dependencies**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Configure environment variables**
    Create a .env file in the project root and add your API keys:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key

3. **Run the agent**
    python ShapefileAgent.py
    Follow the interactive prompt to issue natural language commands.
    The Supervisor and Worker agents will coordinate to generate and execute code, then display results.
